This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at Carnegie Mellon University, a humble effort to make impactful visualizations

I hope you like my work and I would really appreciate feedback that will help me improve along the way! :)

# What I hope to learn

”A man who carries a cat by the tail learns something he can learn in no other way.”
                                                                                  - Mark Twain
                                                                                  
I truly believe that the best way to learn something is to do it! As I build my portfolio peice by peice, I hope to learn the intricasies of Data-Viz which will make me a much better visual communicator. Sometimes the smallest details make a huge difference and I want to learn to focus on some of these in order to make more meaningful and impactful visualisations.
