# Part III: The final deliverable

## Intended audience

A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story.  Include any personas and / or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

As mentioned in [part 1](/final_project_part2_shreya.md), the intended audience for my story is people from all walks of life who are willing to make small changes to their lifestyles in order to strive towards a better future. Since I have had the privilege of sharing this class at Heinz with future policy makers and influencers. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to shed light on the rampant problem of plastic pollution so that we can collectlively work towards finding a fix to this issue that is claiming innocent lives, globally. In order to alleviate this problem, we are going to require policy reforms but before all that, we have to take small steps and make immediate lifestyle changes as citizens of this planet to do our bit. This begins by understanding the problem and the fact that our contribution is an integral part of the solution.

In order to extend the reach of my work, I've kept the visualizations simple and easy to interpret. In addition to this, I have used common chart types that people are familiar with such as, pie-charts, line graphs and lastly, a time-line chart. My aim is to get my message across in the simplest way possible. In my opinion, a chart is most effective when the message it conveys is un-convoluted.

Specific examples of steps I took to make my visualizations easy to understand are as follows:

1. The fish chart:

![fish chart](98percentfishchart.png)

Since the pie chart was representing percentage of fish, I took the liberty to make the pie chart look like a fish. Some one looking at the chart will instantly know that it represents data from a study on fish.

2. The Time line graph:

![generations](line_graph.png)

This timeline chart depicts the number of years it takes for common single-use plastics to degrade. To put the scale of years in perspective and to link it to our life-span, I decided to compare it with the number of human generations that would correspond to the number of years.


3. The Pie-charts with images:

![Animal Pie Charts](pie_charts_animals.png)

I've plotted 3 pie charts that represent statistics on 3 different categories/species of marine life. Since these are reflecting a negative sentiment, the color scheme I've chosen for this is red and grey.
