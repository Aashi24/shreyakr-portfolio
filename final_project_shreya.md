# Part I : Project Proposal


# 1. Outline

### "Plastic or Planet? The choice is easy but change is the challenge!"

## Summary : 

For the final project I have chosen to focus on the problem of plastic pollution which prevails across our planet. I wish to convey the gravity of the problem to my audience by visualising and presenting data collected from reliable sources such as Nat Geo. Not only do I want to make people aware of the problem but also urge them to make small changes to their lifestyles that will contribute to the solution of this problem in a small but significant way.

## Inspiration :

This work is deeply inspired by National Geographics coverage of the problem and their initiatives to curb the menace. I watched a few documentaries which are part of **THE STORY OF PLASTIC** series that changed my mind. I want my work to have the same impact on my readers.


## Approach : 

- The untold story of plastic and its evolution  

-- How did this happen? When did all this begin?
- Putting this in perspective (discuss the scale at which plastic is produced and dumped) 

-- How big is this problem now? Why can't we just recycle
- How Plastic Pollution is affecting the Ocean Wildlife and other living creatures

-- Visuals and Data Visualizations
- Did you know...It is also taking human lives

-- Here's how and how many
- Okay Boomer!

--  We can do better, this is our world, it is in our hands now!
- Common things that are a huge cause of plastic pollution

-- Tooth brushes, plastic bags, sneakers, cigarettes

- The Universe is infinite why can't we trash our plastic there and rid the earth of it?

-- Not unless we have 33 Gazzillion Dollars lying around!

- These are the only plausible alternatives and the change begins with us!

- Call to action : Initiatives people can take or partake in
-- PLEDGE AGAINST PLASTIC, join Nat Geo's initiative and do your part in saving the planet.

## Story Arc :

## Feedback on Story Arc : 

- I really like the scale you've deviced for this story arc (well designed Y-axis) .
- Where do you think you want your Audience to focus? If there is just one take back for them, what would it be?

### Slightly modified Story Arc : 

More emphasis on the call for action :

## Understanding my audience : 

I have learnt through this class that it is essential to understand who our adiuence is in order to connect with them through our work and this is presicely why I have included this section. Well, I have had the privilege of sharing this class at Heinz with future ploicy makers and influencers. So I would like to use this as a thought provoking tool to convince people in this class as well as people across the globe to act fast on this issue. In order to alleviate this problem we are going to require policy reforms but before all that we have to take small steps as a citizens of this planet to do our bit. And this begins by understanding the problem and the fact that our contribution is an integral part of the solution.

## Here's what I want my reader to understand :

As a reader, I want **to be more cognizant of my impact on the environment** so that I can **do my bit to save the planet.**

## Call to Action : 

Take National Geographic's Pledge against Plastic and make a genuine effort to reduce your plastic consumption. Small changes will go a long way! 
As future policy makers and influencers we should all take actions in order to curb this plastic ma

It is time to say "Okay Boomer" and undo the damage done to our planet because of sheer neglect.

# 2. Initial Sketches
Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.


# 3. The Data
Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.

Data: 

- [Google Sheets containing data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AHCi-UIvZsHg_qm53ricrzInUJc23C5QepnS6lw2utg/edit?usp=sharing)

This google sheets link has data collected from multiple sources. Data from different sources are organised in different sheets and each of these sheets has a link to the data source.

The first sheet is a list of all the data sources and their corresponding links.

The rest of the sheets are as listed below:
- 


- [Our world in data - plastic pollution](https://ourworldindata.org/plastic-pollution)



# 4. Method and Medium
A few paragraphs documenting how the project will be completed. Platform for the final project identified.

I will be completing the project in 4 steps

My method of story telling will be through persuasive imagery and data visualizations. I will incorporate the feedback I receive from my peers at each stage in order to make my work more effective and persuasive.

Step I: 
- Conduct thorough research on the topic of plastic pollution
- Outline key points that I would like to convey to the audience
- Collect Data form multiple sources, clean and compile it
- Based on the stroy I would like to share, chart a story arc which will give me a sense of the kind of effect I want each part of my work to have on my audience. 
- Get feedback on the story arc and see if the story is cohesive and engaging.
- Refine the story arc 
- Begin sketching key aspects of the project and piece all the information together.
- Rearrange some parts and

An outline of your project, copies of data, an initial sketch of the idea, and the identified method you'll use for presenting. (due 2/9)
Part II: Wireframes, storyboards, moodboards and user research.  User research and incorporating user feedback. (due 2/16)


Having explored Shorthand and some really interesting content created using the platform, I have decided to build my final project using the tool.
