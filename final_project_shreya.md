# Part I: a project proposal


# 1. outline
Proposal includes a high-level summary of the project (sentence or two); project structure that outlines major elements of the story; story arc is described; call to action is identified.

At a minimum, you should include the following: 

A high-level summary of your project.  This should be a sentence or two that describes what you're interested in showing with your final project.
A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe the story arc that you hope to achieve.  Talk about the anticipated call to action and outline your user stories. 

## One sentence summary :

### "Plastic or Planet? The choice is easy but the change is challenging!"

## Here's what I want my reader to understand :

As a reader, I want **to be more cognizant of my impact on the environment** so that I can **do my bit to save the planet.**

# 2. Initial sketches
Clear and understandable sketches created and available on the Github page. Sketches mimic aspects of the outline and build on message. Story structure is built into sketches.
# 3. The data
Data source identified. A copy of the data, or a recreated version of the data is available via a publicly-accessible link (Github, Box, or other publicly-accessible link). A couple of paragraphs that document data sources and how data will be used.
# 4. Method and medium
A few paragraphs documenting how the project will be completed. Platform for the final project identified.
