The student has created a new section on their portfolio page for the assignment, and organized content effectively. A paragraph on why this visualization was included, a couple paragraphs on what the overall process was, insights gleaned from the critique method and how it led to the redesign are included. Student has documented what the visualization shows, why it was selected, and what they attempted to do differently. For this criteria the student is graded as much on one's ability to see another way of sharing the same data as on the successfulness of any particular change to the data visualization itself. Source information, including a link to original data visualization and an explanation of the data are included.
