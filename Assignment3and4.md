The student has created a new section on their portfolio page for the assignment, 
and organized content effectively. A paragraph on why this visualization was included, 
a couple paragraphs on what the overall process was, insights gleaned from the critique method
and how it led to the redesign are included. Student has documented what the visualization shows, 
why it was selected, and what they attempted to do differently. For this criteria the student is graded 
as much on one's ability to see another way of sharing the same data as on the successfulness of any
particular change to the data visualization itself. Source information, including a link to original data
visualization and an explanation of the data are included.

# New Data Viz

The visualization is recreated using the original source data or data that can be found elsewhere. Student has recreated the visualization using one of the tools from class. The new visualization is effective and would pass the critique test well in most areas, and appears to have been designed to address some of the shortcomings identified in the earlier visualization. The content is carefully crafted in positively impacts the interpretation of the data and visualization. Colors support the understanding of information and don't distract from the message.

# SUMMARY

In my opinion, this critiquing method is highly effective. In general data visualizations are designed to portray patterns and meaning hidden in numeric data.
