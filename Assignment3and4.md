**Background:**
I chose this data visualization from The Economist because of its simplicity. The article talks about how the locus of Christianity is moving downward in many parts of the world while Sub-Saharan Africa represents the faith's greatest hope. The focus of the article, however, is how the Christian-Muslim conflict sputtering across west Africa is hindering with the Pope's plans to visit the continent. The article cites findings of Pew, an American research institute, which indicate that the share of the world’s Christians who live in sub-Saharan Africa will surge to 42% by 2060, up from 26% in 2015. This is precisely what the visualization I have chosen for this exercise represents. It highlights how hristianity would be destined to fall rather swiftly behind Islam as the world’s most popular faith if not for it's adoption in Sub-Saharan Africa.

# 2 : CRITIQUE

## 1. Describe your overall observations about the data visualization here. What stood out to you? What did you find worked really well? What didn't? What, if anything, would you do differently?

**Things that stood out:** <br />
- The **Red line** representing Sub-Saharan Africa draws attention to it immediately which is great.
- The **Chart Title** definitely stood out to me. I had to google what the title implied because I was unaware of it’s significance. In my opinion, the title could have been more self explanatory instead of something so abstract, this will allow the average reader to comprehend it easily.
- The **label** that reads Sub-Saharan Africa aptly conveys that the chart’s main focus is that region.

**What I liked:** <br /> 
- Apt use of **color and typography:** I love how the color red and bold text are used to draw the reader’s attention subtly to the main focus of the chart.  

**What I disliked:** <br /> 
- **Scattered region labels** make it hard to interpret the chart at first glance.
- **Slope charts** typically work when there are fewer variables, there are too many variables here.
- **Overuse of color** is distracting readers from the main focus of the chart, i.e. the increase in the christian population in Sub-Saharan Africa. The other slopes are competing for attention.
- **The Y-Axis ticks** on right causes more eye travel across the chart while interpreting each slope.
- **Actual percentage values** of the points are not printed so it is subject to inaccurate interpretation

**What I would change:** <br /> 
- I would align the **region labels**
- **Reduce the use of colors** in the chart so as to draw attention to the slope corresponding to Sub-Saharan Africa	
- Maybe change the **chart type** and use a bar chart to represent the same information
- I would certainly change the **chart title** to make it more informative and less abstract

## 2. Who is the primary audience for this tool? Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience? Why or why not?

Visualizations are made for consumption by readers. It is therefore, really important to understand the need of the Audience and this begins with identifying who the audience is.  According to me, the primary audience for this visualization are the **readers of The Economist**.

According to me I would rate the effictiveness of this visualization as follows:

### Reference

Few, Stephen. “Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile,” 2017, 11.
http://www.perceptualedge.com/articles/visual_business_intelligence/data_visualization_effectiveness_profile.pdf

**Informative:** </br> 
- Usefulness  - I think this visualization is quite useful, it supports the creator's narrative about the issues faced by the Pope in Sub Saharan Africa, in spite of the fact that Christianity is thriving there.

- Completeness - I think it is only moderately complete because it only teases a decline in the total Christian population across the globe but does not show the actual decline, which is not as high as it may appear.

- Perceptibility - The chart’s perceptibility is slightly low since it takes a while for a reader like me to comprehend what it is trying to convey. Multiple variables in a slope chart make it harder to comprehend

- Truthfulness - The chart does justice to the data it represents. However, it portrays a significant decline in the Christian population in major regions of the world indicating a huge overall decline. This is certainly not true and the total decline over the next 50 years is estimated to be 1%. Therefore, in my opinion, the chart is truthful but lacks some information.

- Intuitiveness - The slope chart indicates the trend (incline or decline) but is not as intuitive	as a bar chart might be.  
 

**Emotive:** </br>
- Aesthetics  - Overall the chart is pleasing to the eye and is not very hard to comprehend
- Engagement - I think the chart is highly engaging because it makes one aware of the current region wise statistics and think further about the bigger picture. For instance, I was prompted to think about the total decline.

Overall, having considered all the above reasons, I think the visualization is moderately effective in conveying its meaning to the audience.

## 3. Final thoughts: how successful was this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here? What would you change? Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)

This critiquing method was very effective in evaluating the data visualization. More importantly, it was very helpful in the whole redesigning process because it helped in identifying exactly what the shortcomings of the visualization are. While this method allows us to gauge the effectiveness of a chart using 7 different criteria, the Good Charts method allows us to be more specific about what we like and dislike in terms of color, typography, etc.  It is definitely more detailed than the good charts critiquing method but I think both of them work really well together. 

If I have to pick out some measures that I feel are missing, I would choose **‘Level of emphasis on the main issue’** and **‘Accessibility’**.

- The level of emphasis on the main issue will be a measure of how well the chart draws the reader's attention to the main point. Here that would be the fact that Sub-Saharan Africa has an increasing trend while the rest have a decreasing trend.

- Accessibility refers to whether the chart retains all important information if plotted in a monotone palette, put differently, whether readers with color blindness can infer all necessary information from it, or not. 


# 3 & 4 : WIREFRAMES AND FEEDBACK

# 1. First try

## Feedback on first iteration:

**Friend 1:**
- "The link between the title of the article and the visualization is not clear. Why would the pope struggle in a place where Christianity is thriving?"
- "It appears as though the % population is not varying in the blue regions. The Fact that the % population of Christians will double in Sub-Saharan Africa is not emphasised enough"
- "Audience: Newspaper readers"
- "Change the title of the article"

**Friend 2:**
- "What is the over all decline in percentage christian population, worldwide?"
- "The chart looks vibrant and is eye catchy, my eyes are drawn to the red bars"
- "Audience: Readers of the economist"
- "Change: Scale the bars appropriately"

### What I learned:

- In order to enhance the completeness of this visualization I should include the overall change in population as well.
- Modify the title of the article itself in order to establish a stronger link between the article and the visualization
- Include a chart title that depicts the idea behind the visualization
- Use a more neutral color for the other regions in order to increase emphasis on the Sub-Saharan-African region

# 2. Second try, after incorporating the feedback received

## Feedback on second iteration:

**Friend 1 (Same as above):**
- "I see the link between the article and the chart now. I like how you used black instead of blue this time around. I would not change anything else."

**Friend 2 (Same as above):**
- "I like how you have included the overall variation in the christian population, worldwide. The chart serves its purpose, I don't think you need to change anything"


# 5 : REDESIGN OF THE VISUALIZATION

# The overall process

These visualizations are a product of what I learned through the new critiquing method. In order to develop these, I had to understand some of the shortcomings of the chosen visualization. Once I had understood the areas for improvement, I used wireframes to design an improved version. An integral part of this process was getting feedback from my friends. Initially, I thought that my first wireframe was flawless. It was only when I sought feedback, that I realized that it needed clarity enhancements and more changes.

I took the constructive feedback and incorporated it into another draft of wireframes. I also chose to add another chart to build a more persuasive visualization. This time around, my wireframe passed the litmus test. Once I had my wireframes ready all that was left was to create the visualization. I designed both the new visualizations using Tableau, which was really easy to use. 

Lastly, I used Stephen Few's critiquing method yet again to check if the new visualizations I created were more effective. In my opinion, they were indeed more effective and easier to comprehend by readers. 

My take away from this exercise is that seeking feedback is absolutely crucial to designing effective and persuasive visualizations.

## How is the new visualization better?

- **Usefulness:** The level of usefullness remains the same
- **Completeness:** By including an additional chart that depicts the overall change in the percentage Christian population, this new visualization paints a more complete picture.
- **Perceptibilty:** The information in Bar charts is more easily perceived than in slope charts
- **Truthfulness:** Truthfulness is marginally improved.
- **Intuitiveness:** Bar charts are familiar visualizations and are more intuitive.
- **Aesthetics:** The new one is less cluttered and pleasing to look at.
- **Engaement:** The level of engagement remains the same.

Overall, this is a good attempt at making the chosen visualization more effective.

# 6 : SUMMARY

In my opinion, this critiquing method is highly effective. It allows us to disassemble various aspects of visualization and gauge its effectiveness holistically. Data visualizations are created with the intent of bringing out the patterns and meaning buried in numeric data. They are designed so that the average reader can grasp its meaning easily, without having to sift through it to gather information. The effectiveness of a data visualization, therefore, relies heavily on the creator's intention to portray a persuasive narrative as well as the reader's reception of the message. This particular method of critiquing data visualizations takes into account both these aspects and is, therefore, a good measure of the effectiveness of a data visualization.

Data-Viz is a powerful tool that can be used to persuade readers. They should be informative and provide intellectual stimuli as well as emotive in the sense that it produces a powerful emotional response in the reader. The Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile critiquing method assesses visualizations from both perspectives which makes it very effective. What I like most about this is that it allows one to assess visualizations from a reader's perspective.  

Since we analyze a visualization using 7 holistic metrics, it helps us identify precisely which area needs enhancement and why a particular visualization isn't quite working. This process helps in the refinement process since we know exactly what to fix in order to make a data-viz more effective.
